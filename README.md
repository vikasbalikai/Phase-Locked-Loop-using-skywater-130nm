# Phase-Locked-Loop-using-skywater-130nm
The basic agenda of this workshop was to design a Phase-Locked Loop using an Open-Source Google-Skywater 130nm node. In this workshop, tools like are Ngspice and Magic are used. Considering a layout and an end product(IC) perspective, the mathematical design aspects are totally avoided here, thus making this workshop a learn-by-doing program. A pre-requisites of Basic Electronics is sufficient.
